              <b><em><p>About me and why Information Technolgy...</p></em></b>
              <p>My name is Vanessa, I am 28, born and raised in Australia in a cute little town that goes by the name of Orange! I grew up dancing to rock ‘n’ roll music and singing Shania Twain, I’m still quite the country girl to this day but living in the suburbs of Sydney with my boyfriend, Chris, and furbaby, Layla. </p>
              <p>I have been working for a tech company now for over a year and during this time I have seen our software change drastically and always improve, ensuring the best experience for the end-user. I am fortunate enough to have worked closely with different teams that make up the IT space, including software engineers and developers; this is how my interest in IT has come about. Our lives are surrounded by technology and it will continue in that direction as it’s a growing space and has lots to offer. The tech space is fascinating and exciting which is why I’ve decided to take the plunge and begin my career path in IT.</p>

              <p>Which brings me to my next point… Upon completing my studies, I expect to have a thorough understanding of the information technology space and how each aspect intertwines to one another. I am looking to develop my skill and knowledge in order to pursue a career in Software Engineering. </p>

<br>
              <b><em><p>But why RMIT?</p></em></b>
              <p>I chose to study with RMIT after comparing a few different universities. As I am working full-time still, I need flexibility to study online. I chose RMIT as their QS rankings for online study in Australia and globally are quite high, along with student experiences and support through OUA. Another massive reason for choosing RMIT is being able to study four terms with no mandatory break was a huge win because I can essentially study full-time over 365 days by doing two units a term (please correct me if I misunderstood!).</p>

              <b><em><p>Ideal Job: Software Engineer </p></em></b>
              <p>The career path I would like to seek is that of software engineering. Software Engineers are involved in all steps of the software development process and this is something I am very passionate about, being across the entire project to ensure we get the best result possible for the end-user. A software engineer is responsible for many things including crucial input during the planning and prototyping stages to ensure requirements are defined. Software engineers are logical thinkers and responsible for the design, development and testing for accuracy and security, including the debugging before and after release. Along with this, they are responsible for the maintenance of the end result, consisting of improvements as well as identifying and removing problems. </p>

              <h2>So what are the skills, qualifications and experience a Software Engineer needs?</h2>
              <p>Software engineers require a Bachelor Degree in a related field such as:</p>
              <ul><li><p>Bachelor of Computer Science or Software Engineering</p></li></ul>
              <ul><li><p>If an alternate degree is obtained such as a Bachelor of Information Technology, a career in software engineering is still possible however, pursuing a graduate certificate/diploma in Computer Science or Software Engineering may provide additional skills and knowledge that you won’t get from a Bachelor of Information Technology.</p></li></ul>
              <ul><li><p>To take your career even further, the individual can obtain a Masters of Engineering (software) or Computer Science</p></li></ul>

              <p>Software engineers must have effective communication as they generally work within a team so they will need to poses excellent time management, be passionate and high-end user focus, and be logical and able to problem solving. Software engineers must be proficient in programming languages, development technologies and web development tools.</p>

              <p>Becoming a Software Engineer can take roughly 4+ years to acquire a junior level position.</p>

            <i><p>"You know how to be genuine and present during interpersonal interactions. You have the emotional intelligence to feel empathy and you know how to express it. Your authenticity means you are generous and share yourself with others. Storytelling is one of your strengths; it is how you connect with people and engage them in a shared vision. Perhaps your biggest gift is the ability to empower the people around you to achieve their best. Your leadership style is a valuable asset for improving your career prospects. A leadership program can help you bring evidence-based practices to your work, adding value for your employer.”</p></i>

      <div class="sectionContent">
            <article>

              <p>When reading through the results of the above mentioned tests, I was actually really surprised with how accurate it was. I believe it is of utmost importance to have self-awareness and to know what your strengths and weaknesses are. I have been on a journey over the last 6 months to improve my own pro-activeness and effectiveness, I am inspired by The 7 Habits of Highly Effective People by Steven Covey and How to Win Friends and Influence People by Dale Carnegie. There is a strong correlation between my journey over the last 6 months and my test results. </p>

              <p>I most certainly am introverted, I am observant, highly practical and down to earth. I am definitely more inclined to “take the back seat” unless, I am completely sure of myself and my knowledge on the matter; I am very much inclined to analyse information down the point which can take up a considerable amount of time. I do connect well with people and being empathetic comes really easily to me, I listen actively and enjoy supporting my colleagues so we can win together! </p>

              <p>I will need to continue to take my strengths and weaknesses into consideration once we begin our group tasks. If I feel uncomfortable or perhaps struggling to understand what is required, I will likely take a step back as I would be ashamed to admit my downfall. I like doing group activities however, the introvert I me likes to do things on my own so I will need to ensure I remain engaged with the group. Being rather meticulous and aiming for perfection can also be difficult to manage at times as I will continue to work on something until I am proud of it and it’s done exceptionally well or that I have no time left to work on it.  </p>

              <p>The only part I disagree with it and was surprised by was the “front-line” leader result however, I can relate to the description of this leadership style, all but story-telling… I am not good at telling a story. </p>

              <p>We have now see doctor appointments change to virtual appointments to ensure we remain isolated… But what happens when things get back to business as usual, how will things look? I preferably would still like to see my doctor in person about important matters, which brings me to my idea. </p>

                  <p>I would like to create a software for the healthcare industry and an application for patients. </p>

                  <p>A bit of background, four years ago I had open heart surgery and a month prior to the surgery, I had so many appointments with different doctors and specialists, along with many tests consisting of various scans and pathology. </p>

                  <p>I was still working full-time but I spent so much time waiting around to see my doctor or to get a test done. Most of these appointments/tests can only be done during the working week. I was really fortunate to work for a company that was understanding of the position I was in and that it didn’t affect my employment. Still to this day I have regular follow ups and require different testing and consultations which means I still spend time waiting around. I’ve also spent my fair share of time in hospital. </p>

                  <p>All this time I have spent waiting around to see my doctors and specialists, in the hospital, getting pathology tests done, waiting to get scans done.. This is time that could be better utilized, won’t affect my job (now that I am in a more senior role) and will allow me to balance my life. </p>

                  <p>Imagine we had an effective, user-friendly software for the healthcare industry that would translate information to an application for patients (of course, super user-friendly) that would allow me to plan ahead and better yet, receive reminders and notifications. </p>

                          <p>Given recent circumstances, this is inefficient and unhygienic, we would look to encourage a change of the current process to a technology based system (i.e. iPad to phone number using QR code technology) with a printout option if the patient doesn’t have a smart phone.
