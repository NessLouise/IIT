              <em><h3>About me and why Information Technolgy...</h3></em>
              <p>My name is Vanessa, I am 28, born and raised in Australia in a cute little town that goes by the name of Orange! I grew up dancing to rock ‘n’ roll music and singing Shania Twain, I’m still quite the country girl to this day but living in the suburbs of Sydney with my boyfriend, Chris, and furbaby, Layla. </p>
              <p>I have been working for a tech company now for over a year and during this time I have seen our software change drastically and always improve, ensuring the best experience for the end-user. I am fortunate enough to have worked closely with different teams that make up the IT space, including software engineers and developers; this is how my interest in IT has come about. Our lives are surrounded by technology and it will continue in that direction as it’s a growing space and has lots to offer. The tech space is fascinating and exciting which is why I’ve decided to take the plunge and begin my career path in IT.</p>

              <p>Which brings me to my next point… Upon completing my studies, I expect to have a thorough understanding of the information technology space and how each aspect intertwines to one another. I am looking to develop my skill and knowledge in order to pursue a career in Software Engineering.
              I chose to study with RMIT after comparing a few different universities. As I am working full-time still, I need flexibility to study online. I chose RMIT primarily due to the QS rankings worldwide and Australia specific for online universities, along with student experiences and support through OUA. Another massive reason for choosing RMIT is being able to study four terms with no mandatory break was a huge win because I can essentially study full-time over 365 days by doing two units a term (please correct me if I misunderstood!). </p>

              <em><h3>Ideal Job: Software Engineer </h3></em>
              <p>The career path I would like to seek is that of software engineering. Software Engineers are involved in all steps of the software development process and this is something I am very passionate about, being across the entire project to ensure we get the best result possible for the end-user. A software engineer is responsible for many things including crucial input during the planning and prototyping stages to ensure requirements are defined. Software engineers are logical thinkers and responsible for the design, development and testing for accuracy and security, including the debugging before and after release. Along with this, they are responsible for the maintenance of the end result, consisting of improvements as well as identifying and removing problems. </p>
<br>

              <h2>What skills, qualifications and experience do Software Engineers need?</h2>
              <p>Software engineers require a Bachelor Degree in a related field such as:</p>
              <p><li>Bachelor of Computer Science or Software Engineering</p>
              <p><li>If an alternate degree is obtained such as a Bachelor of Information Technology, a graduate certificate in Computer Science or Software Engineering will provide the skill and knowledge to pursue software engineering, however, you still can without it.</p>
              <p><li>To take your career even further, the individual can obtain a Masters of Engineering (software) or Computer Science</p>

              <p>Software engineers must have effective communication as they generally work within a team so they will need to poses excellent time management, be passionate and high-end user focus, and be logical and able to problem solving. Software engineers must be proficient in programming languages, development technologies and web development tools.</p>

              <p>Becoming a Software Engineer can take roughly 4+ years to acquire a junior level position.</p>
              <br>
                <h2>The skills, qualifications and experience I already have to be a Software Engineer..</h2>
                <p>I currently do not have many of the skills or knowledge required to become a software engineer other than the soft skills I have developed overtime. I believe these are still rather important skills but continuous improvement is imperative. I am determined and passionate, i enjoy solving problems to then provide a workable solution, I am rather meticulous, and have excellent communication and time management abilities. I am empathic and have exception client-facing skills.</p>

              <p>I now face the challenge of obtaining knowledge and work experience which will all come in due course.</p>
              <br>

              This test also couldn’t be more spot on. I am definitely more inclined to “take the back seat” unless, I am completely sure of myself and my knowledge on the matter; I am very much inclined to analyse information down the point which can take up a considerable amount of time. I will need to take both of these qualities into consideration once we begin our group tasks. In saying that I have experience from current and previous employment in working on projects and in specific teams in order to get a job done, so I was already aware that I have these qualities and continuously try to improve my participation and be more efficient.

              <h2>Primary learning style: Reflector style</h2>
              <p><i>Reflectors prefer to stand back and observe. They tend to be cautious, preferring to take a back seat. They like to collect and analyse information to help them reach their conclusions, which they may take considerable time and effort to develop. Reflectors see the big picture by using information gathered from previous experience as well as the here and now.</p></i>
              <p>Learning methods especially suited to reflectors include:</p>
              <p><li>	Paired discussions</p>
              <p><li>	Self-analysis questionnaires</p>
              <p><li>	Time out [simply build in sufficient breaks to make space for the reflectors]</p>
              <p><li>	Showcase / Demonstrations</p>
              <p><li>	Feedback from others</p>
              <p><li>	Coaching</p>

            <p>I was actually surprised that this test came back as “front-line” leader however, I can relate to the description of this leadership style, all but story-telling… I am not good at telling a story. I do connect well with people and being empathetic comes really easily to me, I listen actively and enjoy supporting my colleagues so we can win together!</p>
            <i><b><h3>Front-line Leader</h3></b>
            <p>"You know how to be genuine and present during interpersonal interactions. You have the emotional intelligence to feel empathy and you know how to express it. Your authenticity means you are generous and share yourself with others. Storytelling is one of your strengths; it is how you connect with people and engage them in a shared vision. Perhaps your biggest gift is the ability to empower the people around you to achieve their best. Your leadership style is a valuable asset for improving your career prospects. A leadership program can help you bring evidence-based practices to your work, adding value for your employer.”</p>
