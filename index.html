      <h1>Personal Information</h1>
      <p>My name is Vanessa, I am 28, born and raised in Australia in a cute little town that goes by the name of Orange! I grew up dancing to rock ‘n’ roll music and singing Shania Twain, I’m still quite the country girl to this day but living in the suburbs of Sydney with my boyfriend, Chris, and furbaby, Layla. </p>
    <p>  I have been working for a tech company now for over a year and during this time I have seen our software change drastically and always improve, ensuring the best experience for the end-user. I am fortunate enough to have worked closely with different teams that make up the IT space, including software engineers and developers; this is how my interest in IT has come about. Our lives are surrounded by technology and it will continue in that direction as it’s a growing space and has lots to offer. The tech space is fascinating and exciting which is why I’ve decided to take the plunge and begin my career path in IT.
      Which brings me to my next point… Upon completing my studies, I expect to have a thorough understanding of the information technology space and how each aspect intertwines to one another. I am looking to develop my skill and knowledge in order to pursue a career in Software Engineering.
      I chose to study with RMIT after comparing a few different universities. As I am working full-time still, I need flexibility to study online. I chose RMIT primarily due to the QS rankings worldwide and Australia specific for online universities, along with student experiences and support through OUA. Another massive reason for choosing RMIT is being able to study four terms with no mandatory break was a huge win because I can essentially study full-time over 365 days by doing two units a term (please correct me if I misunderstood!). </p>

  <h1>Interest in IT</h1>
  <h2>Ideal Job</h2>
  <p>Software Engineer </p>
  <p>The career path I would like to seek is that of software engineering. Software Engineers are involved in all steps of the software development process and this is something I am very passionate about, being across the entire project to ensure we get the best result possible for the end-user. A software engineer is responsible for many things including crucial input during the planning and prototyping stages to ensure requirements are defined. Software engineers are logical thinkers and responsible for the design, development and testing for accuracy and security, including the debugging before and after release. Along with this, they are responsible for the maintenance of the end result, consisting of improvements as well as identifying and removing problems. </p>
